**Hi, I'm Ros â€” a first-year PhD student diving into neuroscience in Taiwan.**

I have a background in statistics and machine learning, and I'm passionate about understanding how people learn, make decisions, and adapt. I'm especially curious about how language, vagueness, and uncertainty shape behavior â€” both in everyday life and in the brain.

This site is where I share my thoughts, short reflections, and ideas â€” and connect with others interested in science, learning, and communication.

Outside of research, I also tutor English, Math, Statistics, and beginner programming online.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out â€” just [contact me here](/contact/).
