Hi, I'm Ros â€” a PhD student in neuroscience based in Taiwan.

My background is in statistics and machine learning, and Iâ€™m passionate about understanding how people learn, make decisions, and adapt. I'm especially curious about how language, vagueness, and uncertainty shape behavior â€” both in everyday life and in the brain.

This site is a space for sharing my thoughts, writing short reflections, and connecting with others interested in science, learning, and communication.

Outside of research, I also tutor English, Math, Statistics, and beginner programming online.
